# Project-Euler

In this project, I have solved some of the questions of **Project Euler** (`https://projecteuler.net/archives`) in **Java** to improve my Logical thinking.

##  Requirements and Installation process

Run the following commands on your terminal to install java on your linux system.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt update; sudo apt install oracle-java8-installer
```

To check the version of java after installing, that you're using, run - `javac --version`.
